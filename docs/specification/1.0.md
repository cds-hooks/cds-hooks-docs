# CDS Services

!!! info "1.0 Draft"
    This is the draft of the 1.0 release of the CDS Hooks specification. We are currently working towards a 1.0 release and would love your feedback and proposed changes. Look at our <a href="http://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues">current issue list</a> and get involved!

## Overview

The CDS Hooks specification describes the RESTful APIs and interactions between EHRs and CDS Services. All data exchanged through the RESTful APIs MUST BE sent and received as JSON structures, and MUST be transmitted over channels secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS). 

### Limitations
This specification has the following limitations.

* The specification provides options for providing a CDS Service access to the EHR's FHIR resources through use of either prefetch and/or a bearer access token to be presented to the FHIR Server.  Decisions regarding which approach to take, and details regarding how the choice is implemented, are left up to the EHR vendor/provider, as architectural considerations will come into play.
* The specification requires that each CDS Service provider be registered (client_id, key-pair identifier) with the EHR Authorization Server, but does not dictate how registration is accomplished (e.g., dynamic vs. manual).
* The specification acknowledges that each EHR vendor/provider will need to vet CDS Service providers and suggests that vendors/providers may want to create a "white list" of providers deemed "safe" and/or a "black list" of providers deemed "unsafe."  Similarly, an EHR vendor/provider may choose to assess the safety of active links embedded in CDS Hooks Cards returned to the EHR.  The specification does not suggest how such vetting is accomplished nor suggest factors to consider, as these judgments are dependent upon each EHR vendor's or provider's existing vetting processes and risk-management policy.

## Swagger (Open API Specification)

The CDS Hooks specification is available as an Open API Specification using Swagger. You can download the [API specification](/specification/1.0-api.yaml) and view it online via the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-hooks/docs/master/docs/specification/1.0-api.yaml).

## Discovery

```shell
curl "https://example.com/cds-services"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "hook": "patient-view",
      "title": "Static CDS Service Example",
      "description": "An example of a CDS service that returns a static set of cards",
      "id": "static-patient-greeter",
      "prefetch": {
        "patientToGreet": "Patient/{{Patient.id}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "hook": "medication-prescribe",
      "title": "Medication Echo CDS Service",
      "description": "An example of a CDS service that simply echos the medication being prescribed",
      "id": "medication-echo",
      "prefetch": {
        "patient": "Patient/{{Patient.id}}",
        "medications": "MedicationOrder?patient={{Patient.id}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Developers of CDS Services must provide a well-known endpoint allowing the EHR to discover all available CDS Services, including information such as the purpose of the CDS Service, when it should be invoked, and any data that are requested to be prefetched.

Note that CDS Hooks service providers offer clinical services, and as such will be responsible (as HIPAA covered entities or business associates) for enforcing the "minimum necessary" rule.  Each CDS service MUST assure that the data elements requested to be "prefetched" are the minimum necessary to fulfill the CDS service request.  

### HTTP Request

The discovery endpoint is always available at `{baseUrl}/cds-services`. For example, if the `baseUrl` is https://example.com, the EHR would invoke:

`GET https://example.com/cds-services`

### Response

The response to the discovery endpoint is an object containing a list of CDS Services.

Field | Description
----- | ---------
`services` | *array*. An array of **CDS Services**

Each CDS Service is described by the following attributes.

Field | Priority | Description
----- | ----- | ---------
`hook`| REQUIRED | *string* or *url*. The hook this service should be invoked on. See [Hook Catalog](#hook-catalog)
`title`| RECOMMENDED | *string*.  The human-friendly name of this service
<nobr>`description`</nobr>| REQUIRED | *string*. The description of this service
`id` | REQUIRED | *string*. The {id} portion of the URL to this service which is available at<br />`{baseUrl}/cds-services/{id}`
`prefetch` | OPTIONAL | *object*. An object containing key/value pairs of FHIR queries to minimally necessary data that this service is requesting that the EHR prefetch and provide on<br />each service call. The key is a *string* that describes the type<br />of data being requested and the value is a *string* representing<br />the FHIR query.<br />(todo: link to prefetching documentation)

### HTTP Status Codes

```

```json
{
   "hookInstance" : "d1577c69-dfbe-44ad-ba6d-3e05e953b2ea",
   "fhirServer" : "http://hooks.smarthealthit.org:9080",

   "prefetch" : {
      "patientToGreet" : {
         "response" : {
            "status" : "200 OK"
         },
         "resource" : {
            "resourceType" : "Patient",
            "gender" : "male",
            "birthDate" : "1925-12-23",
            "id" : "1288992",
            "active" : true
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### HTTP Request

An EHR calls a CDS service by `POST`ing a JSON document to the service
endpoint, which can be constructed from the CDS Service base URL and an
individual service id as `{baseUrl}/cds-services/{service.id}`.  The CDS Hook
call includes a JSON POST body with the following input fields:

Field | Description
----- | -----------
`hook` |*string* or *URL*. The hook that triggered this CDS Service call<br />(todo: link to hook documentation)
<nobr>`hookInstance`</nobr> |*string*.  A UUID for this particular hook call (see more information below)
`fhirServer` |*URL*.  The base URL EHR's [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) server. The scheme should be `https`
`fhirAuthorization` | *object*. The OAuth 2 authorization providing access to the EHR's FHIR server. See the [FHIR Resource Access](#fhir-resource-access) heading of the security section for more information.
`user` |*string*.  The FHIR resource type + id representing the current user.<br />The type is one of: [Practitioner](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html), [Patient](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html), or [RelatedPerson](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/relatedperson.html).<br />For example, `Practitioner/123`
`patient` |*string*.  The FHIR `Patient.id` of the current patient in context
`encounter` |*string*.  The FHIR `Encounter.id` of the current encounter in context
`context` |*object*.  Hook-specific contextual data that the CDS service will need.<br />For example, with the `medication-prescribe` hook this will include [MedicationOrder](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationorder.html) being prescribed.
`prefetch` |*object*.  The FHIR data that was prefetched by the EHR (see more information below)

#### hookInstance

While working in the EHR, a user can perform multiple actions in series or in parallel. For example, a clinician might prescribe two drugs in a row; each prescription action would be assigned a unique `hookInstance`. This allows a CDS Service to uniquely identify each hook invocation.

Note: the `hookInstance` is globally unique and should contain enough entropy to be un-guessable.

#### prefetch

As a performance tweak, the EHR may pass along data according
to the service's [[Prefetch-Template]]. This helps provide the service with all
the data it needs to efficiently compute a set of recommendations. Each key matches a key described in the CDS Service Discovery document; and each value is a FHIR Bundle.entry indicating a response status and returned resource.

Note that in the absence of `prefetch`, an external service can always execute
FHIR REST API calls against the EHR server to obtain additional data ad-hoc.)

    }
  ]
}
```

Field | Description
----- | -----------
`cards` |*array*. An array of **Cards**. Cards can provide a combination of information (for reading), suggested actions (to be applied if a user selects them), and links (to launch an app if the user selects them). The EHR decides how to display cards, but we recommend displaying suggestions using buttons, and links using underlined text.

Each **Card** is described by the following attributes.

Field | Priority | Description
----- | ----- | --------
`summary` | REQUIRED | *string*. one-sentence, <140-character summary message for display to the user inside of this card.
`detail` | OPTIONAL | *string*.  optional detailed information to display. If provided, MUST BE represented in [(GitHub Flavored) Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), without HTML. (For non-urgent cards, the EHR MAY hide these details until the user clicks a link like "view more details...".) 
`indicator` | REQUIRED | *string*.  urgency/importance of what this card conveys. Allowed values, in order of increasing urgency, are: `info`, `warning`, `hard-stop`. The EHR MAY use this field to help make UI display decisions such as sort order or coloring. The value `hard-stop` indicates that the workflow should not be allowed to proceed. 
`source` | REQUIRED | *object*. grouping structure for the **Source** of the information displayed on this card. The source should be the primary source of guidance for the decision support the card represents.
<nobr>`suggestions`</nobr> | OPTIONAL | *array* of **Suggestions**, which allow a service to suggest a set of changes in the context of the current activity (e.g.  changing the dose of the medication currently being prescribed, for the `medication-prescribe` activity). If used, the user MUST BE allowed to choose no more than one suggestion.
`links` | OPTIONAL | *array* of **Links**, which allow a service to suggest a link to an app that the user might want to run for additional information or to help guide a decision.

The **Source** is described by the following attributes.

Field | Description
----- | -----------
<nobr>`label`</nobr>| *string*. A short, human-readable label to display for the source of the information displayed on this card. If a `url` is also specified, this may be the text for the hyperlink.
`url` | *URL*. An optional absolute URL to load (via `GET`, in a browser context) when a user clicks on this link to learn more about the organization or data set that provided the information on this card. Note that this URL should not be used to supply a context-specific "drill-down" view of the information on this card. For that, use `link.url` instead.
`icon` | *URL*. An optional absolute URL to an icon for the source of this card. The icon returned by this URL should be in PNG format, an image size of 100x100 pixels, and must not include any transparent regions.

Each **Suggestion** is described by the following attributes.

Field | Description
----- | -----------
`label` |  *string*. human-readable label to display for this suggestion (e.g. the EHR might render this as the text on a button tied to this suggestion).
`uuid` | *string*. unique identifier for this suggestion. For details see [Suggestion Tracking Analytics](#analytics)
`actions` | *array*. array of objects, each defining a suggested action. Within a suggestion, all actions are logically AND'd together, such that a user selecting a suggestion selects all of the actions within it.

Each **Action** is described by the following attributes.

Field | Description
----- | -----------
`type` |  *string*. The type of action being performed. Allowed values are: `create`, `update`, `delete`. 
`description` | *string*. human-readable description of the suggested action. May be presented to the end-user. 
`resource` | *object*. depending upon the `type` attribute, a new resource or the id of a resource. For a type of `create`, the `resource` attribute contains a new FHIR resource to apply within the current activity (e.g. for `medication-prescribe`, this holds the updated prescription as proposed by the suggestion).  For `delete`, this is the id of any resource to remove from the current activity (e.g. for the `order-review` activity, this would provide a way to remove an order from the pending list). In activities like `medication-prescribe` where only one "content" resource is ever relevant, this field may be omitted. For `update`, this holds the updated resource to modify from the current activity (e.g. for the `order-review` activity, this would provide a way to annotate an order from the pending list with an assessment). This field may be omitted.

Each **Link** is described by the following attributes.

Field | Description
----- | -----------
<nobr>`label`</nobr>| *string*. human-readable label to display for this link (e.g. the EHR might render this as the underlined text of a clickable link).
`url` | *URL*. URL to load (via `GET`, in a browser context) when a user clicks on this link. Note that this may be a "deep link" with context embedded in path segments, query parameters, or a hash.
`type` | *string*. The type of the given URL. There are two possible values for this field. A type of `absolute` indicates that the URL is absolute and should be treated as-is. A type of `smart` indicates that the URL is a SMART app launch URL and the EHR should ensure the SMART app launch URL is populated with the appropriate SMART launch parameters.
`appContext` |*string*.  An optional field that allows the CDS Service to pass context regarding the launch of this SMART app from the CDS card to the SMART app. The `appContext` field should only be valued if the link type is `smart` and is not valid for `absolute` links. The `appContext` field and value will be sent to the SMART app as part of the OAuth 2 access token response, alongside the other launch context when the SMART app is launched.


### No Decision Support

> Response when no decision support is necessary for the user

```json
{
  "cards": []
}
```

If your CDS Service has no decision support for the user, your service should return a 200 HTTP response with an empty array of cards.

## Analytics

Whenever a user clicks a button from a "suggestion" card, the EHR uses the
suggestion `uuid` to notify the CDS Service's analytics endpoint via a `POST`
with an empty body:

    `POST {baseUrl}/cds-services/{serviceId}/analytics/{uuid}`

If a suggestion has no `uuid`, the EHR does not send a notification.

## Prefetch

### A performance tweak

If real-world performance were no issue, an EHR could launch a CDS Service
passing only *context* data, and *without passing any additional clinical data*
up-front. The CDS Service could then request any data it needed via the EHR's
FHIR REST API.

But CDS services must respond quickly (on the order of 500 ms), and so we
provide a performance tweak that allows a CDS Service to register a set of "prefetch
templates" with the EHR ahead of time.

The prefetch templates are a dictionary of `read` and `search` requests to supply
relevant data, where the following variables are defined:

|variable|meaning|
---------|--------
|`{{Patient.id}}`|The id of the patient in context for this activity (e.g. `123`)|
|`{{User.id}}`|The type and id of the user for this session (e.g. `Practitioner/123`)|

An EHR *may* choose to honor some or all of the desired prefetch templates from an appropriate source. For example:

- The EHR may have some of the desired prefetched data already in memory, thereby removing the need for any network call
- The EHR may compute an efficient set of prefetch templates from multiple CDS Services, thereby reducing the number of network calls to a minimum
- The EHR may satisfy some of the desired prefetched templates via some internal service or even its own FHIR server
- The user may not be authorized to share the desired prefetch data.

Regardless of how the EHR satisfies the prefetched templates (if at all), it is important that the prefetched data given to the CDS Service is equivalent to the CDS Service making its own call to the EHR FHIR server, where `{{Patient.id}}` is replaced with the id of the current patient (e.g. `123`) inside of any URL strings and using `read` and `search` operations to the server's "transaction" endpoint as a FHIR batch-type bundle.

The resulting response, which must be rendered in a single page — no "next
page" links allowed — is passed along to the CDS Service using the
`prefetch` parameter (see below for a complete example). 

The CDS Service must not receive any prefetch template key that the EHR chooses not to satisfy. Additionally, if the EHR encounters an error while retrieving any prefetched data, the prefetch template key should not be sent to the CDS Service. It is the CDS Service's responsibility to check to see what prefetched data was satisfied (if any) and manually retrieve any necessary data. If the CDS Service is unable to obtain required data because it cannot access the FHIR server and the request did not contain the necessary pre-fetch keys; the service shall respond with an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status code.

### Example prefetch request

```json
{
  "prefetch": {
    "p": "Patient/{{Patient.id}}",
    "a1c": "Observation?patient={{Patient.id}}&code=4548-4&_count=1&sort:desc=date",
    "u": "Practitioner/{{User.id}}"
  }
}
```

Here is an example prefetch property from a CDS service discovery endpoint. The
goal is to know, at call time:

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `p` | Patient demographics |
| `a1c` | Most recent Hemoglobin A1c reading for this patient |
| `u` | Information on the current user (Practitioner)

### Example prefetch response

```json
{
  "prefetch": {
    "p":{
      "response": {
        "status": "200 OK"
      },
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Patient",
        "gender": "male",
        "birthDate": "1974-12-25",
        "...": "<snipped for brevity>"
      }
    },
    "a1c": {
      "response": {
        "status": "200 OK"
      },
      "resource":{
        "resourceType": "Bundle",
        "type": "searchset",
        "entry": [{
          "resource": {
            "resourceType": "Observation",
            "code": {
              "coding": [{
                "system": "http://loinc.org",
                "code": "4548-4",
                "display": "Hemoglobin A1c"
              }]
            },
            "...": "<snipped for brevity>"
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The response is augmented to include two prefetch values, where the dictionary
keys match the request keys (`p` and `a1c` in this case).

Note that the missing `u` key indicates that either the EHR has decided not to satisfy this particular prefetch template or it was not able to retrieve this prefetched data. The CDS Service is responsible for retrieving this Practitioner data from the FHIR server (if required).

### Prefetch query restrictions

To reduce the implementation burden on EHRs that support CDS services, CDS Hooks recommends that prefetch queries only use a subset of the full functionality available in the FHIR specification. Valid prefetch URLs should only contain:

* _instance_ level [read](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#read) interactions (for resources with known ids such as `Patient` and `Practitioner`)
* _type_ level [search](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#search) interactions
* Patient references (e.g. `patient={{Patient}}`)
* _token_ search parameters using equality (e.g. `code=4548-4`) and optionally the `:in` modifier (no other modifiers for token parameters)
* _date_ search parameters on `date`, `dateTime`, `instant`, or `Period` types only, and using only the prefixes `eq`, `lt`, `gt`, `ge`, `le`
* the `_count` parameter to limit the number of results returned
* the `_sort` parameter to allow for _most recent_ and _first_ queries

## Security

<aside class="notice">
The CDS Hooks security model is undergoing a rigorous security assessment and as such, may be subject to change.
</aside>

CDS Hooks defines the agreed upon security model between an EHR and the CDS Service. Like SMART on FHIR, the security model of CDS Hooks leverages the same open and well supported standards like OAuth 2 and JSON web tokens. However, as CDS Hooks differs from SMART, the manner in which these standards are used is specific to CDS Hooks.

### Trusting CDS Services

As the EHR initiates every interaction with the CDS Service, it is responsible for establishing trust with the CDS Services it intends to call. This trust is established via a TLS connection to the CDS Service. Thus, all CDS Service endpoints must be deployed to a TLS protected URL (https). This includes both the Discovery and individual CDS Service endpoints.

EHRs should use accepted best practices for verifying the authenticity and trust of these TLS connections. For instance, [rfc5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) and [rfc6125](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125). Additionally, it is assumed that EHRs configure the CDS Services they connect to via some offline process according to the business rules and practices of both the EHR and CDS Service organizations.

### Trusting EHRs

Since the CDS Service is invoked by the EHR, the CDS Service does not have the same mechanism as EHRs to establish trust of the EHR invoking it. Signed [JSON web tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) are produced by the EHR and provided to the CDS Service, allowing the CDS Service to establish trust of the calling EHR.

Each time the EHR makes a request to the CDS Service, it must send an `Authorization` header where the value is `Bearer <token>`, replacing `<token>` with the actual JWT. Note that this is for every single CDS Service call, whether that be Discovery calls, CDS Service invocations, etc.

> Example JSON web token payload

```json
{
  "iss": "https://fhir-ehr.example.com/",
  "aud": "https://cds.example.org/cds-services/some-service",
  "exp": 1422568860,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "jti": "ee22b021-e1b7-4611-ba5b-8eec6a33ac1e"
}
```

> Using the above JWT payload, the complete JWT as passed in the Authorization HTTP header would be:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2ZoaXItZWhyLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tLyIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2RzLmV4YW1wbGUub3JnL2Nkcy1zZXJ2aWNlcy9zb21lLXNlcnZpY2UiLCJleHAiOjE0MjI1Njg4NjAsImlhdCI6MTMxMTI4MDk3MCwianRpIjoiZWUyMmIwMjEtZTFiNy00NjExLWJhNWItOGVlYzZhMzNhYzFlIn0.Gwl3s301OMWpdEVAVj_T3JZV8bs7N5-V7QNNG7TQ33o
```

The JWT from the EHR is signed with the EHR's private key and contains the following fields:

Field | Value
----- | -----
iss | *string* The URL of the issuer of this JWT.
aud | *string or array of strings* The CDS Service endpoint that is being called by the EHR. (See more details below).
exp | *number* Expiration time integer for this authentication JWT, expressed in seconds since the "Epoch" (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC).
iat | *number* The time at which this JWT was issued, expressed in seconds since the "Epoch" (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC).
jti | *string* A nonce string value that uniquely identifies this authentication JWT (used to protect against replay attacks)

Per [rfc7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3), the `aud` value is either a string or an array of strings. For CDS Hooks, this is the URL of the CDS Service endpoint being invoked. For example, consider a CDS Service available at a base URL of `https://cds.example.org`. When the EHR invokes the CDS Service discovery endpoint, the aud value is either `"https://cds.example.org/cds-services"` or `["https://cds.example.org/cds-services"]`. Similarly, when the EHR invokes a particular CDS Service (say, `some-service`), the aud value is either `"https://cds.example.org/cds-services/some-service"` or `["https://cds.example.org/cds-services/some-service"]`.

[https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) is a great resource not only for learning about JSON web tokens, but also for parsing a JWT value into its distinct parts to see how it is constructed. Try taking the example JWT here and pasting it into the form at [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) to see how the token is constructed.

<aside class="notice">
At this time, CDS Hooks does not prescribe how the EHR shares its public key or the format of said key used in the JWT signature.
</aside>

#### Mutual TLS

[Mutual TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) (mTLS) may be used alongside JSON web tokens to establish trust of the EHR by the CDS Service.

### Service Registration

Each health system is individually responsible for determining the suitability, safety and integrity of the CDS services it uses, based on the organization's own risk-management strategy.  Each health system SHOULD maintain a "white list" (and/or "black list") of the CDS services it has vetted, and the Card links that have been deemed safe to display from within the EHR context. Each health system is expected to work with its EHR vendor to choose what CDS services to allow and to negotiate the conditions under which the services may be called.  

The EHR’s authorization server is responsible for enforcing restrictions on the CDS services that may be called and the scope of FHIR resources to which each service may be given access.  Therefore, all CDS services to be called from within an EHR system MUST BE pre-registered with the authorization server of that EHR.  Pre-registration MUST include registering a CDS client identifier, and agreeing upon the scope of FHIR access that is minimally necessary to provide the clinical decision support required.  

### FHIR Resource Access

The CDS Service is able to use the FHIR server of the EHR to obtain any additional data it needs in order to perform its decision support. This is similar to SMART on FHIR where the SMART app can obtain additional data via the provided FHIR server.

Like SMART on FHIR, CDS Hooks requires that access to the FHIR server be controlled by an Authorization server utilizing the OAuth 2 framework. Thus, the CDS Service is able to consume the given FHIR server via an access (bearer) token just like a SMART app. While CDS Hooks shares the underlying technical framework and standards as SMART on FHIR, there are very important differences between SMART and CDS Hooks.

#### Obtaining an Access Token

In SMART on FHIR, the SMART app requests and ultimately obtains an access token from the Authorization server using the SMART launch workflow. This process utilizes the authorization code grant model as defined by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework in [rfc6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

With CDS Hooks, the EHR provides the access token directly in the request to the CDS Service. Thus, the CDS Service does not need to request the token from the authorization server as a SMART app would. This is done purely for performance reasons as the authorization code grant model in OAuth 2 involves several HTTPS calls and redirects. In contrast to a SMART app, a CDS Service may be invoked many times during a workflow. Going through the authorization code grant model on every hook invocation would likely result in a poorly performing CDS Service due to the authorization overhead.

```json
{
  "fhirAuthorization" : {
    "access_token" : "some-opaque-fhir-access-token",
    "token_type" : "Bearer",
    "expires_in" : 300,
    "scope" : "patient/Patient.read patient/Observation.read"
  }
}
```

#### Access Token

The access token is specified in the CDS Service request via the `fhirAuthorization` request parameter. This parameter is an object that contains both the access token as well as other related information.

Field | Description
----- | -----------
`access_token` |*string*. This is the OAuth 2 access token that provides access to the FHIR server.
`token_type`   |*string*. Fixed value: `Bearer`
`expires_in`   |*integer*. The lifetime in seconds of the access token.
`scope`        |*string*. The scopes the access token grants the CDS Service.

It is recommended that the `expires_in` value be very short lived as the access token must be treated as a transient value by the CDS Service.

It is recommended that the `scope` value contain just the scopes that the CDS Service needs for its logic and no more.

As the CDS Service is executing on behalf of a user, it is important that the data the CDS Service has access to is under the same restrictions/authorization as the current user. As such, the access token shall be scoped to:

- The CDS Service being invoked
- The current user

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) is web security mechanism that is built into browsers. In short, CORS allows servers to control how browsers access resources on the server, including the accessible HTTP response headers. CORS is only honored by web browsers and as such, is a client-side security mechanism.

For CDS Services, implementing CORS is required if your CDS Service is to be called from a web browser. As the [CDS Hooks Sandbox](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org) is a browser application, you must implement CORS to test your CDS Service in the CDS Hooks Sandbox.

You should carefully consider if and how you support CORS in your CDS Service. A secure implementation guide for CORS is outside of the CDS Hooks specification, as it involves implementation decisions that are made based upon your organization's tolerance for risk and deployment environment.

An insecure, extremely permissive, non-production CORS configuration that allows you to test your CDS Service against our Sandbox returns the following HTTP headers:

Header | Value
------ | -----
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | true
Access-Control-Allow-Headers | Authorization, Content-Type
Access-Control-Allow-Methods | GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Origin | *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers | Origin, Accept, Content-Location, Location, X-Requested-With

## Extensions

The specification is not prescriptive about support for extensions. However, to support extensions, the specification reserves the name `extension` and will never define an element with that name, allowing implementations to use it to provide custom behavior and information. The value of an extension element should be a pre-coordinated JSON object.

For example, an extension on a request could look like this:

```json
{
   "hookInstance" : "d1577c69-dfbe-44ad-ba6d-3e05e953b2ea",
   "fhirServer" : "http://fhir.example.org:9080",
   "hook" : "patient-view",
   "user" : "Practitioner/example",
   "patient" : "1288992",
   "extension" : {
      "com.example.timestamp": "2017-11-27T22:13:25Z",
      "myextension-practitionerspecialty" : "gastroenterology"
   }
}
```

As another example, an extension defined on the discovery response could look like this:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "title": "Example CDS Service Discovery",
      "hook": "patient-view",
      "id": "patientview",
      "prefetch": {
        "patient": "Patient/{{Patient.id}}"
      },
      "description": "clinical decision support for patient view",
      "extension": {
          "example-client-conformance": "http://hooks.example.org/fhir/102/Conformance/patientview"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
