# Hook Catalog

## Pre-defined CDS hooks

This specification describes a set of hooks to support common use cases out of the box. **This is not a closed set**; anyone can define new hooks to address new use
cases. To propose a new hooks please add it to the [proposed hooks](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks) page of the CDS Hooks wiki.

Note that each hook (e.g. `medication-prescribe`) represents something the user is doing in the EHR; various hooks might respond to the same hook (e.g. a "price check" service and a "prior authorization" service might both respond to `medication-prescribe`).

Note also that each hook name in our official catalog is a simple string. If
you want to define custom hooks without submitting them to the catalog, then
you should use a URI (e.g.
`http://my-organization/custom-hooks/patient-transmogrify`).


## `medication-prescribe`

**Purpose**: Inform an external CDS service that the user is in the process of
prescribing a new medication, and solicit feedback about the
prescription-in-progress.

**Contextual data**: The set of proposed medication prescriptions are communicated using the FHIR `MedicationOrder` resource. See example below:

```json
{
   "hookInstance" : "de49f375-3cab-4363-bdf1-d5fbf01f3cd8",
   "fhirServer" : "http://hooks.smarthealthit.org:9080",
   "hook" : "medication-prescribe",
   "context": {
     "resourceType": "MedicationOrder",
     "medicationCodeableConcept": {
       "...": "<snipped for brevity>"
    }
  }
}
```



## `order-review`

**Purpose**: Inform an external CDS service that the user is in the process of
reviewing a set of orders (sometimes known as a "shopping cart"), and solicit
feedback about the orders being reviewed.

**Contextual data**: The set of orders being reviewed on-screen, represented
using a combination of MedicationOrder, DiagnosticOrder, DeviceUseRequest,
ReferralRequest, and ProcedureRequest. See example below:

```json
{
  "hookInstance" : "700a274f-7a73-43e5-bd6e-6858db1a9c00",
  "fhirServer" : "http://hooks.smarthealthit.org:9080",
  "hook" : "order-review",
  "redirect" : "http://hooks2.smarthealthit.org/service-done.html",
  "user" : "Practitioner/example",
  "context": {
    "resourceType": "DiagnosticOrder",
      "...": "<snipped for brevity>"
  }
}
```

## `patient-view`

**Purpose**: Inform an external CDS service that the user has just opened a new
patient record and is viewing a summary screen or "face sheet", and solicit
feedback about this patient.

**Contextual data**: None required beyond default context.

```json
{
   "hookInstance" : "0b197ddc-b510-437b-99ea-aae68a0f9dc7",
   "fhirServer" : "http://hooks.smarthealthit.org:9080",
   "hook" : "patient-view",
   "redirect" : "http://hooks2.smarthealthit.org/service-done.html",
   "user" : "Practitioner/example",
   "context" : [],
   "...": "<snipped for brevity>"
  }
}
```


# Examples

## CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain

**CDS Service Request** on `medication-prescribe`

This example illustrates the use of the CDS Hooks `medication-prescribe` hook to implement Recommendation #5 from the [CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain](https://guidelines.gov/summaries/summary/50153/cdc-guideline-for-prescribing-opioids-for-chronic-pain---united-states-2016#420).
This example is taken from the [Opioid Prescribing Support Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds/), developed in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/).
